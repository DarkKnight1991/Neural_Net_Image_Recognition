# Neural_Net_Image_Recognition
3 layer neural network to recognize digits, trained with MNIST dataset. This project all the code one may need to start building Neural network from scratch for learning purpose. The calculation of derivative for second layer parameters is slightly off so function minimization goes haywire sometimes. Still working on it. Will update the code as soon as fixed.
